# credit-card-fraud-detection
This Python application implements a credit card fraud detection system using a Random Forest classifier, built with a Tkinter-based graphical user interface. The program allows users to upload a credit card transaction dataset, split it into training and testing sets, train a Random Forest model, and make predictions on new data to identify fraudulent transactions. The dataset is expected to contain 31 features including time, amount, and various anonymized variables (V1-V28), with the class label indicating legitimate or fraudulent transactions. The interface provides functionality to view accuracy results, analyze individual transaction predictions, and visualize the distribution of normal versus fraudulent transactions through a bar chart. The Random Forest model is configured with balanced class weights to handle imbalanced data typical in fraud detection scenarios, and the system generates detailed output showing prediction results for each test transaction along with overall accuracy metrics.
